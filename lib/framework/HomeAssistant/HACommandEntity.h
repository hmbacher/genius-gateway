/**
 * @brief MQTT infrastructure base for command-only HA entities (button, trigger, scene).
 *
 * Publishes a discovery config with a command_topic and subscribes to it.
 * Invokes the provided Action on every incoming MQTT message.
 * Has no state - does not publish to a state_topic.
 *
 * Entity-specific HA discovery fields (e.g. payload_press for button) are
 * passed as a ConfigBuilder lambda to the constructor. The lambda runs after
 * the topology fields (command_topic, unique_id) have been set, so it can
 * add or override them.
 *
 * Common fields (name, icon, entity_category, ...) use the typed setters
 * inherited from HAEntityBase.
