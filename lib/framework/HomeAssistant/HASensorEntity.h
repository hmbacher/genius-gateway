/**
 * @brief MQTT infrastructure base for state-only HA entities (sensor, binary_sensor, event).
 *
 * Publishes a discovery config with a state_topic. Has no command_topic -
 * HA cannot send commands to this entity.
 *
 * State is published on every MQTT (re)connect via publishAll(), and can be
 * refreshed at any time by calling publishState() - typically from a periodic
 * timer or when the underlying value changes.
 *
 * The ValueReader lambda returns the current value as a String and is called
 * every time the state needs publishing. Conversions (e.g. bool → "ON"/"OFF",
 * float → String) are the caller's responsibility.
 *
 * Entity-specific HA discovery fields (unit_of_measurement, device_class,
 * state_class, value_template, payload_on/off, ...) are passed as a
 * ConfigBuilder lambda to the constructor.
 *
 * Common fields (name, icon, entity_category, ...) use the typed setters
 * inherited from HAEntityBase.
