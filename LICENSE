### Commons Clause License Condition v1.0

The Software is provided to you by the Licensor under the License, as defined below,
subject to the following condition:

Without limiting other conditions in the License, the grant of rights under the License
will not include, and the License does not grant to you, the right to Sell the Software.

For purposes of the foregoing, "Sell" means practicing any or all of the rights granted
to you under the License to provide to third parties, for a fee or other consideration
(including without limitation fees for hosting or consulting/support services related to
the Software), a product or service whose value derives, entirely or substantially, from
the functionality of the Software.

**Note**: Third-party frameworks and libraries (ESP32SvelteKit, Arduino, etc.) retain their original licenses. Please refer to their respective license files in the source code.

**Rationale:** The AGPL-3.0 with Commons Clause ensures that improvements to the reverse-engineered protocol implementation remain open source while prohibiting commercial use without permission.

## Third-Party Components

This project builds upon and includes components from other open source projects. These third-party components retain their original licenses:

### ESP32 SvelteKit Framework
- **License:** LGPL v3 (backend), MIT (frontend)
- **Author:** theelims
- **URL:** https://github.com/theelims/ESP32-sveltekit
- **Usage:** Base framework for ESP32 web applications
- **Note:** The ESP32 SvelteKit framework retains its original licenses. Genius Gateway modifications and additions to the framework are licensed under AGPL-3.0 + Commons Clause.

### Arduino Libraries
Various Arduino libraries used are subject to their respective licenses. See individual library documentation for details.

### PsychicHttp
- **License:** LGPL v2.1
- **URL:** https://github.com/hoeken/PsychicHttp
- **Usage:** HTTP server library for ESP32

## License Compatibility and Important Notes

### Third-Party Dependencies
This project uses third-party libraries and frameworks that retain their original licenses:
- **ESP32 SvelteKit**: LGPL v3 (backend), MIT (frontend)
- **PsychicHttp**: LGPL v2.1
- **Arduino libraries**: Various licenses (see respective library documentation)
- **Other dependencies**: See individual library documentation for license details

### License Interaction
- **Genius Gateway code** is licensed under AGPL-3.0 + Commons Clause (more restrictive than underlying frameworks)
- **Third-party components** retain their original licenses (LGPL, MIT, etc.)
- **Hardware designs** (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) and **Documentation** (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) are independent of software licenses

### Important Legal Considerations

1. **AGPL-3.0 Network Requirement**: If you provide the software as a network service (e.g., hosting it on a server accessible to users), you must make the complete source code available to those users.

2. **Commons Clause Restriction**: The Commons Clause prohibits selling the software or offering it as a paid service. This means:
   - ❌ You cannot sell the software itself
   - ❌ You cannot offer it as a hosted/SaaS service for a fee
   - ❌ You cannot provide consulting/support services where the value primarily comes from the software
   - ✅ You can use it personally or for educational purposes
   - ✅ You can modify and share it non-commercially

3. **Hardware & Documentation**: Both use CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, which prohibits commercial use without permission.

### Commercial Use

**All components (hardware, software, documentation) prohibit commercial use without explicit permission.**
